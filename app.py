"""
Simple TODO API built with Flask.

This application exposes a few REST endpoints to manage a list of tasks in memory.
Each task has an ``id``, a ``title``, an optional ``description`` and a boolean
flag ``done``.  The API allows clients to list existing tasks, create new tasks,
mark a task as completed and delete tasks.  It is deliberately kept simple and
stateless: tasks are stored in a Python list that resets each time the
application restarts.  In a production system you would persist data to a
database or external store, but for the purposes of this exercise an
in-memory store keeps the focus on the CI/CD and security aspects.

Metrics are automatically exported via the ``/metrics`` endpoint thanks to
the ``prometheus_flask_exporter`` library.  This allows Prometheus to scrape
standard HTTP request metrics such as request durations and counts.  See
``requirements.txt`` for all dependencies.

To run the application locally:

.. code:: bash

   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python app.py

The server will listen on ``http://0.0.0.0:5000`` by default.  When running
inside Docker, the exposed port can be mapped to a host port (see
``Dockerfile`` and ``docker-compose.yml``).
